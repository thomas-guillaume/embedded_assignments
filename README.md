# Project
A gym club application.

## Assignment 1
For this first assignment, we only designed the user interface of the app. We started by a splash screen which show the logo and redirects to another screen. The user can choose to sign up or sign in. If he wants to sign up, he have to enter his first and last name, an email address and a password. If he wants to sign in, he have to enter his email and password. Then, he arrives on the home page, where he is supposed to see the news of the gym club in a list view. He can go to the booking page or to his account page thanks to a bottom navigation bar and a system of fragments. On the booking page, the user can choose a date and trainers in order to book a training. On his account page, he can change his password, go to the settings of the app, or log out.
